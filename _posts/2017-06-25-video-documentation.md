Well, just want to share my failure. Whenever I'm editing a video, there are things I clearly know I shouldn't do, but I just can't resist to not do it. The whole project thought of lost its meaning because of the way I edit the clips to the bgm.  Anyway, hope I do better in the next cut.

It is hard to decide on a specfiic meaning I am giving it though, I find the multiposibility of it much more fascinating.
