## THe MFA Show
<br>
Here's [The MFA Exhibition Official Website.](https://sites.saic.edu/gradshow2021/grad-exhibition/)
<br>
<br>

Apparently, the school forgot I existed, and so I did not get assigned a spot in the exhibition space. 
But since I need to be in the show in order to graduate...I was given a spot in a hallway last minute.

On another wall, I have a super personal video playing.

I was so upset I didn't do any documentation myself. Thanks to all the vistors who found my crap instagram worthy.

When life gives you lemon...I guess you cry, say fuck u, and then turn it into a joke.
