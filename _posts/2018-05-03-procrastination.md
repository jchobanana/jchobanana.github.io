Cool...I've been catching up BBC's Sherlock series and many other Netflix shows instead of getting ready for the last two weeks of my SAIC life.  I'm actaully panicking all the time, can't even falll asleep because of how worry I am.  Yet I am not doing anything to make the situation better...

I just bought the complete Sherlock Holmes Book Series last ngiht.
