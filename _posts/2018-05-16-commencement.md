So, last month, my friends came to Chicago for my commencement. One of them never had the chance to walk the commencement stage, so I offered her the opportunity to do it for me. While the security was strict, nobody realized she was not the Asian girl depicted on my student id. Woohoo. It was all fun until I realized nobody realized this little prank we did loll The Dean of the Graduate Studies was just in my crit a day ago, and we had some personal conversations. But nothing felt strange when he read my name and gave the diploma to my friend :D Of course, I know, it was probably a very frustrated situation for them, since they are all just really focused and trying to pronounce the names correctly. So yea, no offend taken, just thought to make fun of it for my personal pleasure.
